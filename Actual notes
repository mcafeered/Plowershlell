use xfreerdp /u:student /v:<IP_Address> /dynamic-resolution +glyph-cache +clipboard to get into the windows gui

always start with update-help

use -force to make a cmdlet do something without asking

use -Erroraction which specifies what to do with an error when it comes up

use -showwindow to show a man page in a separate windowget_help

 get-childitem -path C:\ -recurse -filter *.pf -name  ----  a script displaying the use of different modules for a command
 switch parameter is boolean, when used the parammeter is one, while not in use its turned off (-recurse) is the switch (boolean operator) 
 
 get-service -name power,Dnscache  ----  can separate multiple values to one parameter via the use of a comma, spaces delimit different parameters
 modules have positional parameters that dont need to be declared and can be found by finding the value out on its own without a parameter 
 ex. get-service power,Dnscache  ----  the -name doesnt need to be declared since powershell finds the first values without a parameter and applies the positional parameter to said value
 
 get-command gets commands that are used in powershell
 use -verb <pattern to search for> to find specific commands 
 can also use -noun <pattern> to find specific commands 
 both of these use astericks to denote whether it starts or stops with the pattern ex. *item or item*
 can also just use get-command *<keyword>* without a parameter to search for said keyword ignoring noun or verb, though this requires the use of astericks
 
 can also use get-help *<keyword>* to also search the help files for commands
 
 can use get-alias -name to find aliases (or use $alias:<alias name>) 
 can use set-alias <alias name> <alias command> to create aliases which can be deleted using del alias:<alias name>
 
 when using variables in powershell variables must be declared and called using a $ ex. $var = 17 
 can still do $var - 1 = 16
 can create multiple variables on one line using commas between calls ex. $var,$var1=17, 23
 you can also chain ='s to make multiple variables equal one number ex. $var1 = $var2 = 17
 when using the get-variable cmdlet you omit the $
 $args an enumerator which enumerates through undeclared input
 $input an enumerator which enumerates all input passed from a function
 $_ or $PSItem contains the current object in the pipeline
 $Profile contains the full path of the powershell profile for the current user
 $null is the void black hole pit of infinite emptiness
 $true and $false are used to decide truity or falsity
 environmental variables are system wide variables that load every time on startup which can be called using $env:<varName> to view what value is being stored in said variable
 remove variables using remove-item variable:<variable name>
 variables can have their type changed (ex. string integer) which can be viewd using <variable>.gettype().name
 can force something to be an integer using [int]$int="27" using the [int or float or string or array] to change the type temporarily
 powershell automatically converts hexadecimal into human-readable format
 
 create an array using $array=@() to create an empty array
 $number_arr= 4,5,6 is also considered an array by powershell, one variable holding multiple values
 [array]$blank_array="" when creating an array in this way you must have some sort of value attributed to said array which means it must have 1 value when counted (throws off indexes)
 can get the count of indexes in an array using <name of array>.count for the number of objects in said array
 arrays can have values added to them using <name of array> += <value>
 $array -is [array] is a way to write "is this object an array?"
 $poly_arr = (get-computerinfo), "help me, im trapped" , 6472 is a polymorphic array which contains many different values
 index numbers can be referenced using <array>[<index>] or <arrray> | select-object -index <number> -1 still indexes the last index in the array while also referencing multiple indexes using [1,5,456]
 for sequential numbers just do it like bash 4..50 which iterates through the entire range of given numbers
